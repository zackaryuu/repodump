# Product Context: PowerEagle Plugin Manager

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Electron applications, particularly specialized tools like Eagle (digital asset manager), often need extensibility but lack a user-friendly way for end-users to create and manage custom functionality. Existing solutions are either too complex (requiring full development setup) or too limited (basic configuration only).

### User Pain Points
1. **Technical Barrier**: Users want to customize their applications but don't want to learn complex development workflows
2. **Security Concerns**: Installing unknown code into applications poses security risks
3. **Management Complexity**: No centralized way to manage multiple customizations
4. **Discoverability**: Hard to find and share useful customizations with community

## Target Users

### Primary User: Power Users
- **Profile**: Technical users who understand basic scripting but want quick wins
- **Goals**: Customize application behavior, automate repetitive tasks, enhance UI/UX
- **Pain Points**: Too much setup overhead for simple customizations
- **Success Metrics**: Can install and use plugins within 2 minutes

### Secondary User: Developers
- **Profile**: Software developers who want to extend Eagle application
- **Goals**: Build and distribute sophisticated plugins, test experimental features
- **Pain Points**: Need robust development environment and distribution system
- **Success Metrics**: Can develop, test, and deploy plugins efficiently

### Tertiary User: End Users
- **Profile**: Non-technical users who benefit from community plugins
- **Goals**: Use plugins created by others to enhance their workflow
- **Pain Points**: Overwhelmed by technical options, need simple install process
- **Success Metrics**: Can discover and install useful plugins without technical knowledge

## Solution Vision

### Core Value Proposition
"Tampermonkey for Electron Apps" - A user-friendly plugin system that makes app customization as easy as browser extension management, while maintaining security and performance.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Multiple Complexity Levels**: From simple JSON configs to full JavaScript plugins
2. **Integrated Experience**: Built into the host application, not external tool
3. **Template-Driven**: Pre-built patterns for common use cases
4. **Security-First**: Sandboxed execution with permission system

## User Journey

### New User Onboarding
1. **Discovery**: User finds plugin manager in app menu/toolbar
2. **First Impression**: Clean interface with clear "Install Plugin" button
3. **Template Selection**: Choose from pre-built templates for common patterns
4. **Customization**: Modify template or paste existing code
5. **Installation**: One-click install with immediate feedback
6. **Success**: Plugin works immediately, user sees value

### Power User Workflow
1. **Development**: Create complex plugins using full JavaScript API
2. **Testing**: Enable/disable for quick iteration
3. **Management**: Organize multiple plugins with clear status indicators
4. **Sharing**: Export plugins for community sharing (future)

### Error Recovery
1. **Clear Feedback**: Detailed error messages with suggested fixes
2. **Safe Defaults**: Plugins disabled by default, easy rollback
3. **Help System**: Templates and examples readily available
4. **Community Support**: Documentation and examples (future marketplace)

## Business Impact

### For Eagle Application
- **User Retention**: Enhanced customization keeps power users engaged
- **Community Growth**: Plugin ecosystem attracts developers and users
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique extensibility feature vs competitors
- **Reduced Support**: Users solve their own problems through plugins

### For Plugin Developers
- **Low Barrier Entry**: Simple formats for quick wins
- **Scalable Complexity**: Can grow from simple to sophisticated plugins
- **Distribution Channel**: Built-in sharing mechanism (future)
- **Recognition**: Community visibility for plugin creators

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- Plugin installation rate (target: 60% of power users try it)
- Active plugin usage (target: 40% of users have 1+ enabled plugins)
- Template usage vs custom code (expect 80% start with templates)

### User Experience
- Time to first successful plugin install (target: <2 minutes)
- Error rate during installation (target: <10%)
- User satisfaction scores for plugin management interface

### Technical Performance
- Plugin execution performance impact (target: <5% app slowdown)
- Memory usage with multiple plugins (target: <50MB additional)
- Security incident rate (target: 0 confirmed security issues)

## User Stories

### Epic: Basic Plugin Management
- As a user, I want to install a plugin from code so I can customize my app
- As a user, I want to enable/disable plugins so I can control what's active
- As a user, I want to see plugin status so I know what's working
- As a user, I want to uninstall plugins so I can clean up unwanted customizations

### Epic: Plugin Creation
- As a power user, I want plugin templates so I can start quickly
- As a developer, I want full JavaScript access so I can build sophisticated features
- As a user, I want clear examples so I can learn plugin development
- As a user, I want error feedback so I can fix broken plugins

### Epic: Plugin Discovery (Future)
- As a user, I want to browse available plugins so I can find useful ones
- As a developer, I want to share my plugins so others can benefit
- As a user, I want plugin ratings so I can find quality plugins
- As a user, I want plugin categories so I can find relevant ones

## Competitive Analysis

### Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey
- **Strengths**: Mature ecosystem, familiar UserScript format
- **Weaknesses**: Browser-only, complex for non-developers
- **Lessons**: UserScript metadata format, template system importance

### VSCode Extensions
- **Strengths**: Rich API, great developer experience, marketplace
- **Weaknesses**: Complex for simple customizations, development overhead
- **Lessons**: Extension lifecycle management, permission system

### Browser Extensions
- **Strengths**: Easy discovery, one-click install, automatic updates
- **Weaknesses**: Limited customization, security model complexity
- **Lessons**: Simple installation flow, clear permissions

## Design Principles

### Accessibility First
- Multiple complexity levels (JSON → DSL → JavaScript)
- Clear visual feedback and status indicators
- Comprehensive error messages with solutions

### Security by Default
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Limited API surface with explicit permissions
- Safe defaults (plugins disabled until explicitly enabled)

### Performance Conscious
- Lazy loading of plugin code
- Minimal impact on host application
- Efficient storage and memory management

### Community Oriented
- Sharing-friendly plugin format
- Template system for knowledge transfer
- Documentation-driven development
