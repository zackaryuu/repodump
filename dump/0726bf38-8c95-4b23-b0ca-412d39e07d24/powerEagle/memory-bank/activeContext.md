# Active Context: PowerEagle Plugin Manager

## Current Status (July 1, 2025)

### Development Phase: Core System Complete ✅
The foundational plugin management system is fully implemented and functional. All core features are working, including plugin installation, execution, and management through a modern React-based UI.

### What's Working Now
- ✅ **Plugin Installation**: All three plugin types (Script, JSON, DSL) can be installed
- ✅ **Plugin Management**: Enable, disable, uninstall functionality works
- ✅ **Sandboxed Execution**: Secure plugin execution environment operational
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Complete React interface with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ **Template System**: Pre-built templates for quick plugin creation
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: LocalStorage-based plugin persistence
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Reactive UI with immediate status feedback
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

### Recent Fixes and Improvements
1. **Sandbox Execution Issues**: Fixed JavaScript execution errors in plugin sandbox
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved unused import and parameter warnings
3. **UserScript Parsing**: Enhanced metadata parsing for better compatibility
4. **UI Polish**: Improved plugin cards, status indicators, and error feedback

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. System Stability
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Ongoing monitoring

The core system is stable but needs continued testing with various plugin types and edge cases. Focus on:
- Plugin execution reliability
- Error boundary testing
- Memory management validation
- Storage persistence verification

### 2. User Experience Refinement
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Iterative improvements

The UI is functional but can be enhanced for better usability:
- More intuitive plugin status indicators
- Better error messaging with suggested solutions
- Improved template discovery and selection
- Enhanced plugin management workflows

### 3. Security Hardening
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Basic security implemented

Current sandbox provides basic security but can be strengthened:
- More restrictive API surface
- Better input validation
- Plugin permission system (future)
- Security audit of execution environment

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Plugin Type Strategy
**Decision**: Support three distinct plugin types
**Rationale**: Caters to different user skill levels and use cases
**Implementation**: 
- Script plugins for Tampermonkey compatibility
- JSON plugins for configuration-driven features
- DSL plugins for declarative simplicity

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Flexible for different user types
- ✅ Easy migration from existing tools
- ❌ More complex parsing logic
- ❌ Multiple code paths to maintain

### 2. Security Model
**Decision**: Function constructor with limited scope
**Rationale**: Balance between security and functionality
**Implementation**: Controlled sandbox with curated API surface

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Reasonable security for trusted plugins
- ✅ Good performance and compatibility
- ❌ Not suitable for untrusted code
- ❌ Limited compared to iframe sandboxing

### 3. Storage Strategy
**Decision**: LocalStorage for all persistence
**Rationale**: Simple, reliable, and sufficient for current scale
**Implementation**: Hierarchical JSON storage with error handling

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simple implementation and debugging
- ✅ Synchronous API for easy usage
- ❌ Size limitations (5-10MB typical)
- ❌ Potential blocking on large operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/component has one clear purpose
2. **Interface Segregation**: Plugin APIs split by capability areas
3. **Dependency Injection**: Context pattern for plugin API access
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through events

### UI/UX Patterns
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple options first, advanced features discoverable
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time status updates and error messages
3. **Template-First**: Guide users with working examples
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed plugins don't break the system

### Security Patterns
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal API surface by default
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers
3. **Safe Defaults**: Plugins disabled by default, explicit enable required
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Distinct separation between plugin and host code

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
1. **Sandbox Complexity**: JavaScript execution sandboxing is more complex than expected
   - Function constructor works but has limitations
   - Modern JS features need careful handling
   - Error propagation requires custom handling

2. **React State Management**: Plugin state requires careful synchronization
   - Local state vs external state management
   - Event-driven updates work well for real-time UI
   - Hook pattern provides good abstraction

3. **TypeScript Benefits**: Strong typing caught many potential runtime errors
   - Interface-driven development improved API design
   - Type safety for plugin metadata prevented bugs
   - Path aliases significantly improved import ergonomics

### UX Learnings
1. **Template Importance**: Users heavily rely on working examples
   - Most users start with templates rather than writing from scratch
   - Good templates reduce support burden significantly
   - Template variety covers most common use cases

2. **Error Message Quality**: Clear error messages are crucial for adoption
   - Generic errors frustrate users quickly
   - Specific suggestions for fixes increase success rate
   - Error context (what was being attempted) helps debugging

3. **Plugin Discovery**: Finding relevant functionality is a key challenge
   - Categories and tags help but need to be well-designed
   - Search functionality will be important for scale
   - Community curation may be necessary

### Architecture Learnings
1. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between core and UI pays dividends
   - Easy to test individual components
   - UI can be swapped without touching business logic
   - Plugin types can be added without major refactoring

2. **Event System**: Observer pattern works well for loose coupling
   - Real-time UI updates without tight dependencies
   - Easy to add new event listeners for features
   - Debug-friendly with clear event traces

3. **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage enables future flexibility
   - Easy to swap storage backends
   - Testing with mock storage is straightforward
   - Storage logic separated from business logic

## Next Steps and Priorities
