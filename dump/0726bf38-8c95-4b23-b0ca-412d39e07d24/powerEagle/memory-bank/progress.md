**Decision**: Support multiple plugin complexity levels
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully addresses different user skill levels
- Script plugins attract Tampermonkey users
- JSON plugins work well for configuration-driven features
- DSL plugins provide good balance of power and simplicity

#### 2. Sandbox Security Model
**Decision**: Function constructor with limited scope
**Outcome**: ✅ Good balance of security and functionality
- Sufficient security for trusted plugin environment
- Good performance characteristics
- Compatible with most JavaScript patterns users expect

#### 3. React + TypeScript Architecture
**Decision**: Modern frontend stack with strong typing
**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent developer experience and maintainability
- Caught many potential runtime errors at compile time
- Component-based architecture scales well
- Hook-based state management works well for plugin state

#### 4. Event-Driven Updates
**Decision**: Observer pattern for plugin state changes
**Outcome**: ✅ Clean separation and reactive UI
- UI updates automatically when plugin state changes
- Easy to add new event listeners for features
- Good debugging experience with clear event flow

### Architecture Decisions Under Review

#### 1. LocalStorage for Persistence
**Current**: Works well for current scale
**Concerns**: May hit size limits with many plugins
**Future**: Consider IndexedDB for larger storage needs

#### 2. Synchronous Plugin Execution
**Current**: Simple sequential execution
**Concerns**: Could block UI with long-running plugins
**Future**: Consider Web Workers for plugin isolation

#### 3. Single Plugin Manager Instance
**Current**: Singleton pattern for state management
**Concerns**: Could be challenging for testing and extension
**Future**: Consider dependency injection for better testability
