# Project Brief: PowerEagle Plugin Manager

## Project Overview

PowerEagle is a Tampermonkey-like plugin management system designed for Electron applications. It provides a comprehensive framework for users to install, manage, and execute custom plugins in a secure, sandboxed environment.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Plugin Management System**: Create a user-friendly interface for installing, enabling, disabling, and uninstalling plugins
2. **Multiple Plugin Types**: Support JavaScript/UserScript, JSON configuration, and simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) plugins
3. **Secure Execution**: Implement sandboxed plugin execution with controlled API access
4. **Modern UI**: Build with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui for a polished user experience
5. **Template System**: Provide pre-built templates for common plugin patterns

### Secondary Goals
1. **Plugin Marketplace**: Future integration with community plugin sharing
2. **Developer Tools**: Enhanced debugging and development experience
3. **Advanced Security**: Permission-based plugin system
4. **Export/Import**: Plugin backup and sharing capabilities

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **Build System**: Vite with TypeScript compilation
- **Target Platform**: Electron application (Eagle app plugin)
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistence

### Architecture Requirements
- Modular plugin system with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture for plugin lifecycle management
- Sandboxed execution environment for security
- Reactive UI with real-time plugin status updates

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Install plugins from code (Script, JSON, DSL formats)
- [x] Enable/disable plugins with immediate effect
- [x] Persistent storage of plugin data and settings
- [x] Template system for quick plugin creation
- [x] Real-time UI updates reflecting plugin status
- [ ] Plugin marketplace integration
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Advanced permission management

### Quality Requirements
- Type-safe implementation with comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- Responsive UI that works across different screen sizes
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Performance optimization for large numbers of plugins
- Security measures to prevent malicious plugin execution

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Core plugin management functionality
- Three plugin types: Script, JSON, DSL
- Modern React-based UI
- Basic security sandboxing
- Template system
- Local storage persistence

### Out of Scope (Future Versions)
- Network-based plugin marketplace
- Advanced component plugins (React/Vue embedding)
- Plugin versioning and update system
- Advanced debugging tools
- Plugin performance monitoring

## Key Decisions

### Plugin Types Strategy
1. **Script Plugins**: Tampermonkey-compatible UserScript format for maximum compatibility
2. **JSON Plugins**: Configuration-driven plugins for data-centric use cases
3. **DSL Plugins**: Simplified declarative syntax for common operations

### Security Approach
- Sandboxed execution using Function constructor with limited scope
- Controlled API surface through context objects
- No direct file system or network access (controlled through APIs)

### UI/UX Strategy
- Tab-based interface: Installed, Templates, Marketplace
- Card-based plugin display with status indicators
- Modal-based installation and configuration

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Core System (Completed)
- ✅ Plugin Manager class implementation
- ✅ Plugin type parsers and validators
- ✅ Sandboxed execution system
- ✅ Basic UI components

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI (Completed)
- ✅ Complete plugin management interface
- ✅ Template system implementation
- ✅ Error handling and notifications
- ✅ Responsive design

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Plugin marketplace integration
- Advanced security features
- Export/import functionality
- Performance optimizations

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Security vulnerabilities** in plugin execution → Mitigated by sandboxing
- **Performance issues** with many plugins → Future optimization needed
- **Storage limitations** in localStorage → Consider alternative storage

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex installation process** → Mitigated by templates and examples
- **Poor error messages** → Comprehensive error handling implemented
- **Confusing UI** → Clean, intuitive design with shadcn/ui
